## Welcome to my little project.

Net-Scan is a simple, fast, lightweight, threaded IP4 network scanner written in Rust.
It uses a simple command line interface and can do a ping sweep to detect devices on a network, 
scan a single host for open ports 
or scan a range of ports on a given subnet.

*Make sure to include ports.txt in same location as executable file to identify open port numbers. 
Feel free to update or add port#=description entries to meet your needs. 


### *** CAUTION *** 
ONLY use this application on networks that you own or have written permission to scan. 
This application does not in any way mask the origin of the scan and this activity may be 
interpreted as a cyberattack and/or have legal repercussions. 
I am not responsible for how you use this tool or the consequences resulting from its use.
